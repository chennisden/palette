# The LaTeX package palette - version 1.0.0 (2021/07/27)

**palette** provides the ability to create custom color palettes and symbol palettes ("symbol suites"), and swap one palette in for another easily. It also allows the user to create a variable that represents the selected palette, and provides checks in case the variable represents a palette that does not exist.

The package is split into `colorpalette` and `symbolsuite`.
